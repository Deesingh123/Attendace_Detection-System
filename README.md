# Attendace_Detection-System


The Attendance Detection System is an AI-powered application built using Python, Machine Learning (ML), and MediaPipe to automate attendance marking through real-time face detection and recognition. This system is designed to eliminate traditional manual attendance processes, reducing errors and saving time, especially in classrooms, offices, and events.

The system captures live video feed through a webcam, detects faces using MediaPipe's Face Mesh, and identifies individuals using a machine learning model trained on facial embeddings. Once a face is recognized, the attendance is automatically recorded and stored securely in a CSV file or database. The solution provides a contactless and efficient way of managing attendance without any physical interaction.

Key features include real-time face detection, automatic attendance marking, and secure data storage. The system is easy to deploy and can be extended with features like an admin dashboard, mask detection, and cloud-based data management.

Technologies used in this project are MediaPipe, OpenCV, scikit-learn/TensorFlow for ML, Pandas for data handling, and Tkinter/PyQt for optional GUI support.

This Attendance Detection System is an ideal solution for modern attendance management, combining accuracy, speed, and ease of use.
